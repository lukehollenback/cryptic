# Cryptic

![Status: Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green.svg)

What starts out as a regular Halloween evening for Oliver quickly turns into a confusing, disturbing
mystery that must be solved. Explore the town of Auburn in search of answers. Will you be able to
figure out what is going on?

Inspired by underground classics of the past – like Twisterghost's LOLOMGWTFBBQ series – Cryptic is
a short, eerie roguelite where you must help out friends, explore interesting areas, and ultimately
figure out what happened. If you are up for the challenge, start playing now.
